		<p>Even though most of the photos I have are of her sleeping and laying down, she actually is very active. Orange cats
			are known to be wild and very chaotic.
			It's a lot easier to take pictures of a sleeping cat than one zooming around the apartment. 
		</p>
		
		<p>Here she is in all her glory sleeping and not biting me or my roommates. Petting her is so much easier as well. 
			It's actually very rare
			to get her to sleep and lay down with you, but when she does, I take the opportunity to take ample pictures.She doesn't seem to have a particular position she likes sleeping in.
